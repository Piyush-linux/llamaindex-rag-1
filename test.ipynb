Cats are both predator and prey, they are lone hunters that exhibit \\nterritorial behaviour, preferring familiar territory; they have an acute a wareness of their physical and \\nsocial environment. \\n \\nThey are intelligent, playful and agile. They are often more active dusk and dawn when their prey is also \\nactive, whilst spending long periods of the day resting. \\n \\nCats have a complex and flexible social life – they live in groups of related individuals when resources \\nallow. Related females may live in colonies, sharing the care of their kittens. Males may also provide \\ncare for related young, but they often live a solitary life on the periphery, occupying larger territories that \\noverlap with several female colonies. \\n \\nCats prefer to be with familiar (often related) individuals, over strangers; their friendly behaviour towards \\none another is evident during grooming or rubbing against one another; familiar and socially bonded \\ncats may often be found resting, sleeping and playing together. However, cats are frequently aggressive \\ntowards unfamiliar individuals that enter their territory. \\n \\nCats communicate using visual (body postures, facial expressions, tail carr iage) and chemical signals \\n(transmitted through urine, faeces, scratching and rubbing); they have a wide range of calls and sounds \\nthat provide information on their emotional state. These modes of communication help to moderate their \\nsocial interactions. \\n(Bradshaw et al 2012; Turner & Bateson 2013) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThese guidelines should be read in conjunction with: \\nSupplementary Guidance for Responsible Breeders: Early Socialisation and Habituation of Kittens ( to \\nfollow) \\nGuidelines on Commercial Movement of Cats and Dogs (https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/welfare/eu-\\nplatform-animal-welfare/platform_conclusions_en) \\nGuidelines for Online Platforms Selling Dogs ( https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/welfare/eu-platform-\\nanimal-welfare/platform_conclusions_en) \\n \\n \\nAcknowledgements: \\nAnimal and Plant Health Unit, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Finland \\nAnimal Health and Welfare Department, National Food Chain Safety Office of Hungary  \\nAnimal Health and Welfare Division, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Ireland \\nAnimal Welfare Department, Environment Brussels, Belgium \\nAnimal Welfare Inspector, Transport, Flanders, Belgium  \\nAnimal Welfare Office, Ministry for Agriculture and Food of France \\nAnimal Welfare Unit, Federal Ministry for Food and Agriculture, Germany \\nAnimal Welfare Unit, General Direction of Food and Veterinary, Ministry of Agriculture, Portugal \\nAnimal Welfare Unit, Government of Flanders, Belgium \\nAnimal Welfare Unit, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of Spain \\nAnimal Welfare Unit, Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, Netherlands \\nAnimal Welfare Unit, Public Service of Wallonia, Belgium \\nDipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy \\nEurogroup for Animals ', mimetype=None, path=None, url=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Introduction \\nPoor breeding practices have profoundly detrimental effects on cat welfare and on the well -being of \\nowners; the consequences of poor breeding practices may lead to a lifet ime of suffering, through poor \\nhealth and poor suitability as pets, resulting in an untimely death, abandonment or relinquishment. \\nBreeders, legislators, competent authorities, veterinarians, and owners have an ethical responsibility to \\nwork together to ensure cats live a good quality of life.  \\n \\nCats and kittens have the same need to live a good quality of life regardless of breeding context and all \\nbreeders1 are required to act responsibly and with compassion to meet those needs. These guidelines \\nare intended to support the enforcement of responsible breeding and good animal welfare practices by \\ncompetent authorities. Where national legislation in a country sets higher criteria than those outlined in \\nthese guidelines, the national legislation should take precedence. \\n \\nResearch into animal welfare and breed- specific predispositions to disease that inform responsible \\nbreeding practices are ongoing; breeders and competent authorities should follow current best practices \\nwhere these exceed the guidelines. This requires both breeders and competent authorities to regularly \\nupdate their knowledge of cat welfare. \\n \\nAnimal welfare is a state within the animal that ranges from poor -through-to-good (Broom 1996). For \\nexample, poor welfare arises when a cat is sick or injur ed or unable to express natural behaviours it is \\nhighly motivated to perform; it is associated with negative emotions such as fear, distress, frustration, \\nor boredom. Good welfare results when cats’ experience positive physical and mental states (Green & \\nMellor 2011; Mellor 2016), they are thriving – they are physically healthy, and living in a complex and \\ninteresting environment where they have choice over what they do and when they do things; they feel \\ncomfortable and secure; they have access to all neces sary resources. Cats experience a good quality \\nof life when they are thriving. \\n \\nBreeders have a duty of care, to keep all cats in a state of good welfare, to ensure kittens have a good \\nstart in life – they are functionally fit, healthy and socialised – they fulfil their potential to live a good \\nquality of life in their new homes. Breeders are obliged to find responsible homes for kittens they have \\nbred; ensuring new owners are a good match and understand their lifelong duty of care to their new cat.  \\n \\n \\n2. Principles of responsible breeding \\nA responsible cat breeder (adapted from RSPCA Australia 2018):  \\n \\nRespects the intrinsic value of cats  \\n● Demonstrates a genuine concern for the welfare of cats and their future generations. Avoids \\nbreeding from banned breeds  and their hybrids, animals that are closely related, or with \\n                                                           \\n1 Regardless of whether breeding is planned or accidental, cats and kittens should be cared for in the same way to protect and \\npromote their welfare. The guidelines apply whether kittens are sold or transferred without a fee to a new owner. \\n ', mimetype=None, path=None, url=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The breeder must avoid inbreeding. \\n \\n● Inbreeding Coefficient. Selective breeding of individuals should not be undertaken without \\nknowing the genetic similarity between two parents over the highest number of generations \\n(e.g. at least 5). Breeders should avoid breeding from individual cats that produce a high \\ncoefficient of inbreeding (greater than 20%; Governing Council of the Cat Fancy 2015), ideally \\nthis coefficient should be below 10% (Governing Council of the Cat Fancy 2017).  \\n \\n● Popular Sire Effect. The ‘popular sire effect’ reduces genetic diversity of breeds which often \\nleads to deleterious consequences for many future generations (Gough et al 2018). Breeders \\nshould avoid overusing stud cats in the breeding population. As a general rule, cats should not \\nsire more than 5% of the total kittens, in the specific pedigree population, during a 5- year \\nperiod3. \\n \\nUse genetic Screening: Breeders are required to use all available, validated screening tests relevant to \\nthe breed4 and in conjunction with veterinary advice (Lyons 2010), before they choose to breed from a \\ncat. Screening tests will identify ‘carrier’ cats that are unaffected by the disease but carry the mutated \\ngene; breeding between two carrier cats should be avoided to prevent their kittens  being affected. The \\nresults of genetic screening tests should be provided to prospective new owners of kittens.  \\n \\nAvoid breeding for extremes: Cats may suffer as a result of extreme conformations, for example, \\nBrachycephalism (being flat-faced), which produces anatomical defects to cats’ skull affecting the brain, \\neyes and upper airway, predisposing individuals to life-long neurological and eye-related problems, and \\ndifficulties in breathing, sleeping (sleep apnoea), overheating and regurgitation (Internat ional Cat Care \\n2016).  \\n \\n● Cats with extreme conformation5 (or those who have had corrective surgery) must not be bred \\nfrom (or presented in breeding exhibitions); the corrective surgery should be noted in the \\nrelevant health information alongside their microchip registration, and where appropriate health \\npassport.   \\n \\n3.4 General health requirements \\n● Both stud and queen must receive prophylactic health care under the direction of a veterinarian, \\nincluding regular vaccinations, thorough clinical examination, and treatment for internal and \\nexternal parasites. The timing of treatments must be under veterinary direction as some may \\nbe harmful to the foetus if given during pregnancy or lactation. \\n \\nVaccination \\nCats should be vaccinated by a veterinarian before mating;  queens recently vaccinated before \\npregnancy will produce antibodies in colostrum (first milk) which will be passed on to kittens during \\nnursing, conferring temporary immunity to specific diseases. \\n \\n                                                           \\n3 Further research is needed to understand the acceptable threshold for cats. \\n4 https://www.langfordvets.co.uk/diagnostic-laboratories/services/cat-genetic-testing/  \\n5 https://www.wir-sind-tierarzt.de/download/BTK_Flyer_Qualzucht-Katze.pdf  ', mimetype=None, path=None, url=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Animals that are incompatible (due \\nto physical size or behaviour) must not be mated. Mating that results in large kittens or large \\nlitter sizes may increase the risk of dystocia. \\n \\n● Mating pairs should be physically separated from other animals and housed in accommodation \\nlarge enough for two cats (Section 5.2). The queen needs a separate area away from the stud \\ncat where she can access food, water, litter tray and a bed. The stud cat needs an easily \\naccessible elevated perch or shelf for retreating away from the queen after mating.  \\n \\n● Following mating, breeders are required to carefully check both cats for signs of injury. \\nVeterinary advice should be sought and followed if necessary.

The objectives\\nof the present paper are threefold. The first is to trace the\\njourney of the modern cat through the ancient world and to the\\nAmericas, thereby supporting origins of domestication. The\\nsecond objective is to measure any changes in genetic diversity\\nthat may have occurred during the movement of cats from the\\nFertile Crescent. The third objective is to measure any loss of\\ngenetic diversity that might be ascribed to the development of\\nolder (foundation) or more contemporary breeds. Genetic data,\\nreported herein, are derived from over 1100 cats, representing\\n17 populations of random-bred cats dispersed over five regions\\n(Europe, Mediterranean, Asia, Africa, Americas), as well as 22\\nrecognized breeds, including both foundation and several\\nmodern breeds (Table 1). Highly polymorphic microsatellite\\nmarkers [15] were used to determine genetic relationships of cat\\nbreeds, geographical origins, and the levels of genetic loss due\\nto inbreeding.\\nResults\\nPhylogeographical structure of domestic cats\\nA Bayesian analysis of random-bred cat populations using the\\nsoftware STRUCTURE[16] elucidated the phylogeography of the\\ndomestic cat. The clustering patterns were examined with ancestral\\ngroups (K) set between 2 and 4. The first split (K=2) se pa ra te d\\nAsian and East African cats from all other populations (Fig. 1a).\\nThe Mediterranean basin populations were separated from the\\nEuropean populations atK= 3. East African cats formed a separate\\nand distinct cluster atK=4. The result of theK= 4 analysis clearly\\ndelineated four genetic clusters of cats, corresponding to Europe,\\nthe Mediterranean basin, East Africa, and Asia.\\nWe next included cat breeds in the Bayesian analyses to\\ndetermine the most basal relationships among all cat breeds and\\nall random-bred cat populations. AtK= 2, 4 of 5 Asian random-\\nbred cat populations grouped with 6 of 7 Asian breeds with\\nposterior probabilities of 75–85%; this grouping of 10 popula-\\ntions was also distinct from all other cat populations (Fig. 1b). At\\nK=3, the groupings were refined into a Southeast Asian cluster,\\na Western European cluster, and a cluster that included all other\\ncats from the Mediterranean basin, East Africa, and Northern\\nAsia. Cats from Singapore were an admixture of cats of Asian\\nand European origins. American random-bred cats grouped with\\nrandom-bred cats from Western Europe. Italian cats appeared to\\nbe an admixture of European and Mediterranean stock.\\nSoutheast Asian breeds clustered with the feral populations\\nfrom Vietnam. Of the Asian breeds, only the Japanese Bobtail\\ngrouped strongly with Western cats, albeit with some Asian\\ninfluence. The two breeds that originated in the United States\\n(Maine Coon and American Shorthair) clustered with the seven\\nWestern European breeds. The Persian breed unexpectedly\\nclustered with cats from Western Europe. The Sokoke, an\\nindigenous African breed, was closely related to random-bred\\ncats from Kenya.\\nWe constructed neighbor-joining trees to provide addition-\\nal confirmation of the genetic structure, as well as an alterna-\\ntive way to represent the phylogeographical patterns. Both\\nCavalli-Sforza's chord measure[17] and Nei's genetic dis-\\ntance [18] gave similar results. The tree produced by chord\\nmeasure (Fig. 2) had stronger support, as indicated by boot-\\nstrap values greater than 50%, and differentiated the Asian\\ncluster from all other cats. In addition, East African, Medi-\\nterranean, and European clusters each formed monophyletic\\nclades. This phylogeographical structure was also supported\\nby factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) (Figs. 3 and S1).\\nCats from the rim of the Arabian Sea, Sri Lanka and\\nAbyssinians, bridged the European and Asian groups. While\\nAsian populations were highly dispersed, the Western\\nEuropean cats formed a tight cluster.\\nGenetic diversity within the domestic cat\\nGenetic differentiation was determined by analysis of mo-\\nlecular variance (AMOVA) [19] for cat populations from\\nEurope (including the Americas), East Africa, the Mediterra-\\nnean and East Asia (Table S1). The American samples were\\nincluded with the European populations, as no domestic cats\\nwere indigenous to the Americas. The greatest genetic diver-\\nsity was found in cats from the Mediterranean (500 alleles\\nacross all markers). Asian cats had substantially fewer alleles\\n(418 across all markers). The Mediterranean cats also had 41\\nprivate alleles, compared to 14 private alleles among Asian\\ncats (Table S2).\\nGenetic structure of cat breeds\\nBayesian clustering was used to examine the genetic\\nrelationships among breeds. A range of cluster numbers was\\nexamined, with 20 chosen as the most appropriate. This method\\nseparated the cats into inferred clusters corresponding to their\\nbreed designation (Fig. 1c) and with a purported accuracy of\\n95% [20]. Cats from 14 breeds were assigned to distinct clusters\\nby this statistical analysis. The separation of 8 breeds, 4 pairs,\\nwas not consistent. Singapura and Burmese, Havana Brown and\\nSiamese, Korat and Birman, and Exotic Shorthair and Persian\\ncould not be distinguished as distinct breeds.

The Mediterranean\\nbasin has been previously suggested as the site for cat domestica-\\ntion based on archeological evidence[1,21]. Driscoll and col-\\nleagues [14] used mitochondrial sequence and microsatellite\\nmarkers to elucidate the origin of cat domestication. Because\\nmicrosatellite markers are a better indicator of more recent\\ngenetic diversity, this study focused on microsatellite markers to\\nevaluate the more recent breed origins. Based on the present\\nstudy, genetic diversity was not substantially decreased by the\\nsubsequent diaspora of modern cats from the Mediterranean to\\nother areas of the ancient world. However, there were interesting\\nregional differences in their genetic makeup. FCA, Bayesian\\nclustering, and neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees divided all\\nof the world's cats into four distinct groups: Asia, Mediterranean\\nbasin, Western Europe, and East Africa. American cats consis-\\ntently grouped with cats from Western Europe, suggesting Eu-\\nropean settlers probably brought cats to the New World and the\\ncat's time in America has been too brief for significant genetic\\ndifferentiation.\\nGenetic diversity remained fairly uniform among various\\nareas within the Mediterranean region. The constant movement\\nof ships and caravans, as well as cats, in this key region of early\\ncivilization would have promoted a constant interchange of cats.\\nAlthough Mediterranean cats tended to be genetically uniform,\\nthere were some interesting differences and relationships\\nbetween certain areas within the Mediterranean region. Bayesian\\nanalysis indicated that Italian and Tunisian cats were an\\nadmixture of Western European and Mediterranean cats.

This may have\\nbeen a relic of British colonialism or recent importation.\\nAccording to the FCA ( Fig. 3), Sri Lankan cats and the\\nAbyssinian breed bridged cats of the East and West, perhaps\\nresulting from maritime trade routes in the Arabian Sea or again\\nfrom recent British colonialism. The most interesting difference\\ninvolved the Asian cluster of cats, which was genetically distinct\\nfrom cats of the Mediterranean basin, Western Europe, and\\nAfrica. This pattern of genetic diversity indicates that the first\\ndomestic cats reached the Far East relatively early, followed by a\\nlong period of relative isolation. This isolation may have been\\ncaused by the waxing and waning of trade between successions\\nof great ancient empires. The Asian population was of further\\ninterest because it was internally segregated. Populations of cats\\nfrom different parts of Asia (random bred and purebred) were\\nmore genetically divergent from one another than local\\npopulations within the Mediterranean basin or Western Europe-\\nan clusters. This partitioning of genetic diversity within the\\nAsian population was also corroborated by the longer branch\\nlengths within the Asian clade on the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2).\\nThis suggests not only that the Asian population was relatively\\nisolated from the three other regional clusters, but also that cats\\nwithin various regions of Asia were kept separate.\\nGenetic variation across random-bred and purebred\\npopulations\\nThe substructuring of populations is important for parentage\\nanalyses, forensic applications, individual matching, and disease\\nstudies. Random-bred cats have the largest within-population\\nvariance, consistent with their larger population sizes, freedom\\nto migrate, and no artificial selection. However, the various\\nbreeds of cats exhibit the largest among population variance,\\nreflecting their distinctness. The within-population variance\\ncomponent of random-bred cats was 86%, compared to 93–95%\\nin humans [22], suggesting that individual cat populations are\\nless genetically variable than human populations. Purebred cats,\\nwith a within-population variance component of only 61%, were\\nless genetically variable than the random-bred populations,\\nwhich was also reflected in the estimates of average heterozy-\\ngosity. The average heterozygosity of the breeds was 10% lower\\nthan that of the random-bred populations (Fig. 4), which in turn\\nwas 10% lower than the average for human populations. World-\\nwide human populations range from 0.50 to 0.78 in average\\nheterozygosity, most being above 0.70.

The Burmese and\\nSingapura breeds have the lowest heterozygosity and the highest\\nFIS of any breed, reflecting the most intense inbreeding (Fig. 4).\\nThe newest CFA breed, the Siberian, had the highest variation,\\ncomparable to random-bred populations. This indicates that it\\nwas derived from a broad foundation stock. The Sphynx, which\\nis a derivative of the Devon Rex breed, also had high genetic\\ndiversity. Given these results, Burmese and Singapura breeders\\nshould be concerned about genetic diversity, while Siberian\\nbreeders should be encouraged to retain existing diversity as\\ntheir breed becomes more established. Similar to the conserva-\\ntion efforts in captive exotic felid populations, genetic analyses,\\nbreed histories, and population dynamics could be used to\\ndevelop breed management or survival programs to maintain\\ngenetic variation within the breed gene pool for an extended\\nperiod of time. In addition, these regional differences in the\\ngenetic variation of cats suggest that the genetic markers used in\\ncat DNA profiling should be tested in the diverse populations to\\nvalidate their efficiency.\\nGenetic structure and origins of cat breeds\\nWe have demonstrated that genetic diversity following\\ndomestication was regionalized in areas of the ancient world\\nand even within localities within those regions. Some differ-\\nences could be explained by isolation, while others were best\\nexplained by interchanges of animals between clusters and\\nlocalities. All of these differences involved human activities, but\\nwere probably not strictly intentional. However, intentional\\nchanges in the genetics of cats ultimately occurred during the\\ndevelopment of breeds.\\nUnlike breeds of domestic horses, dogs, cattle, sheep, etc.,\\nsome of which are thousands of years old, most cat breeds were\\ndeveloped within the past 150 years, mainly in Europe and the\\nUnited States[12]. Although documentation for nearly 80 cat\\nbreeds exists, the largest cat fancy association recognizes only\\n41 breeds[23,24]. The Persian, Russian Blue, Siamese, and\\nAngora were among the first cat breeds registered by cat\\nassociations. The CFA designates 16 cat breeds as“natural” or\\n“foundation.” Fifteen of the foundation breeds are included in\\nthis study, lacking only the Manx, the tailless breed of cat that\\nwas developed on the Isle of Man.\\nPurebred cats had similar structuring to the random-bred cats\\nof their regions. The Southeast Asian breeds, including Birman,\\nBurmese, Havana Brown, Korat, Siamese, and Singapura, form\\na grouping that is distinct and at the opposite end of the genetic\\nspectrum from the Western breeds, as depicted by the FCA. The\\nAbyssinians and Japanese Bobtails were exceptions and\\npossessed genetic markers common to both Southeast Asian\\nand Western breeds. This indicates that cats from both Asia and\\nEurope were used to create these breeds.\\nEach of the foundation breeds was genetically distinguish-\\nable with 95% accuracy from the others. One of the oldest\\nrecognized cat breeds, the Persian, has been used in the\\nFig. 4. Genetic diversity indices of breeds, random-bred populations, and wildcats.

Crossbreeding with\\nPersian cats is often used to produce a more brachycephalic\\nhead type. The Exotic Shorthair is essentially a shorthaired\\nvariant of the Persian, which is demonstrated by the complete\\nclustering of these two breeds as one group. The most dolichoce-\\nphalic breed, the Siamese, has also been used to create numerous\\nother breeds, including Colorpoints, Orientals, Havana Browns,\\nand longhaired breed variants. Although listed as different, most\\nof these derived breeds vary by only a single gene variant, such\\nas hair length, color patterns, or fur coloration; thus, these\\nderived breeds will likely be inseparable as distinct breeds, as\\nwas shown with the Havana Brown and Siamese. The Burmese\\nand Singapura grouping proved to be an additional example of\\nrecent breed derivations. The close associations of the Persian\\nand Exotic, the Siamese and Havana Brown, and the Burmese\\nand Singapura resulted in the highest branch supports in the\\nneighbor-joining tree and the inability to separate members of\\neach pair by the genetic markers used in this study. However, it is\\nimportant to remember that most breeds have a written/oral\\nhistory in addition to a genetic fingerprint. Cat breeding folklore\\ncontends that both Burmese and Singapura are indigenous to\\nancient Burma. Folklore also suggests that Burmese cats from\\nthe United States were taken to Singapore, purposely bred with\\nnative cats, and then later returned to the United States as the new\\nbreed Singapura. Havana Browns are considered a separate\\nbreed in the United States; however, European cat breed\\nassociations consider them only a color variant of Siamese.\\nThese data show that most, but not all, foundation or modern\\nbreeds appeared to have originated from random-bred cats of\\nthe purported region of origin. The Southeast Asian breeds were\\nstrongly associated with the random-bred cats from Vietnam,\\nChina, Korea, and Singapore. The Siberian is one of the newest\\ncat breeds from Russia and is actively under development.\\nRandom-bred cats from Russia were not available, but the\\nSiberian had strong associations with cats from the nearby\\ncountries of Germany and Finland. Turkish Vans grouped with\\nregional random-bred cats from Turkey, Israel, and Egypt.\\nLikewise, cats from the Kenyan islands of Lamu and Pate group\\nwith the Sokoke breed, which was developed in Kenya. The\\nKenyan islands and the mainland were accessed via shipping\\nroutes in the Arabian Sea, allowing exchange between India, the\\nNear East, the Arabian Peninsula, and Africa. All other breeds\\nand random-bred populations form a network of closely related\\nand less distinctive cats of Western European grouping. Surpris-\\ningly, the Persian breed was not genetically associated with\\nrandom-bred cat populations from the Near East, but grouped\\nwith random bred cats of Western Europe. The Persian is\\nperhaps the oldest recognized cat breed and has undergone\\nselection for an extreme phenotype, which likely involved\\ncomplex gene interaction. Even though the early Persian cat\\nmay have in fact originated from ancient Persia, the modern\\nPersian cat has lost its phylogeographical signature. Similarly,\\nthe Japanese Bobtail does not appear to hail from its stated\\norigins of Japan. Although cats were not indigenous to Japan,\\nthey migrated to the islands as part of Asian trade routes\\nhundreds of years ago. Introduced as a breed in the United\\nStates in 1968, Japanese Bobtails from the United States appear\\nto have been influenced more in their gene pool by European\\ncats than by Asian cats. Egyptian Maus also appear to be on the\\nverge of losing their historical origins via genetic influences from\\nEurope. Overall, these results indicate that both the random-bred\\nand the breed populations group in a manner largely concordant\\nwith geography. Breed histories, for the most part, appear to be\\naccurate.\\nThis study reconfirmed that the Mediterranean was the likely\\nsite of domestication of the modern cat. Genetically distinguish-\\nable clusters of cats were found in the Mediterranean, Europe,\\nAsia, and Africa. North American cats were closely linked to\\nEuropean cats. The Asian cluster was genetically unique, indi-\\ncating that it became isolated following its introduction. Genetic\\ndiversity remained surprisingly broad among cats from various\\nparts of the world. Genetic data demonstrated that most, but not\\nall, foundation breeds originated from indigenous cats of the\\nregions of purported origin and that this was associated with\\nsome loss of diversity. Researchers should recognize the relative\\nrecent development of the breeds, which influences linkage\\ndisequilibrium and the power of association studies. This study\\nalso provides a warning to modern cat fanciers that breed devel-\\nopment must be done slowly and with the maintenance of a broad\\ngenetic base. Over 20 deleterious genetic disorders have been\\nrecognized in modern cats, and all have been identified in pure\\nbreeds. The elucidated genetic relationships of the cat breeds can\\nbe used by cat breeders to develop more efficient breed\\nmanagement plans.\\nMaterials and methods\\nSample collection and DNA isolation\\nOur dataset consisted of 22 cat breeds, including 15 of 16 supposed\\nfoundation breeds, 2 breeds under development, Siberian and Sokoke, and 5\\nmore recently developed breeds, including Exotic Shorthair, Havana Brown,\\nJapanese Bobtail, Singapura, and Sphynx (Table 1). We obtained DNA samples\\nof most breeds at cat shows and by request from cat owners in the United States.\\nKorat, Turkish Angora, Turkish Van, and Siberian samples were acquired from\\nthe United States and Europe because these breeds have the same standards\\nbetween continents. We reviewed pedigrees to ensure that no first-degree\\nrelatives were included in the study and that a majority of cats did not share\\ncommon grandparents. The random-bred cats included feral cats that have no\\nfeeding or housing assistance from humans, random-bred cats that have had\\nsome influence by humans, and cats owned and cared for by humans but that are\\nnot of a specific breed. For random-bred populations, we did not include\\nlittermates or both parents and their kittens. We used sterile cytological brushes\\nto noninvasively obtain buccal (cheek) cells and the QIAmp DNA mini kit\\n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) to extract the DNA. Samples from Kenya and U.S.\\nrandom-bred populations were provided as blood or tissue, and we extracted the\\nDNA using standard phenol/chloroform[25].
