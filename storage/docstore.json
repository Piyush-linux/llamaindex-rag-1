Welfare 3 November 2020 - DOC/2020/11982 Rev1. \n \nAbout cats  \nThe domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) retains many behaviours and needs of their wild ancestor, the \nAfrican wildcat (Felis silvestris libyca). Cats are both predator and prey, they are lone hunters that exhibit \nterritorial behaviour, preferring familiar territory; they have an acute a wareness of their physical and \nsocial environment. \n \nThey are intelligent, playful and agile. They are often more active dusk and dawn when their prey is also \nactive, whilst spending long periods of the day resting. \n \nCats have a complex and flexible social life \u2013 they live in groups of related individuals when resources \nallow. Related females may live in colonies, sharing the care of their kittens. Males may also provide \ncare for related young, but they often live a solitary life on the periphery, occupying larger territories that \noverlap with several female colonies. \n \nCats prefer to be with familiar (often related) individuals, over strangers; their friendly behaviour towards \none another is evident during grooming or rubbing against one another; familiar and socially bonded \ncats may often be found resting, sleeping and playing together. However, cats are frequently aggressive \ntowards unfamiliar individuals that enter their territory. \n \nCats communicate using visual (body postures, facial expressions, tail carr iage) and chemical signals \n(transmitted through urine, faeces, scratching and rubbing); they have a wide range of calls and sounds \nthat provide information on their emotional state.

Introduction \nPoor breeding practices have profoundly detrimental effects on cat welfare and on the well -being of \nowners; the consequences of poor breeding practices may lead to a lifet ime of suffering, through poor \nhealth and poor suitability as pets, resulting in an untimely death, abandonment or relinquishment. \nBreeders, legislators, competent authorities, veterinarians, and owners have an ethical responsibility to \nwork together to ensure cats live a good quality of life.  \n \nCats and kittens have the same need to live a good quality of life regardless of breeding context and all \nbreeders1 are required to act responsibly and with compassion to meet those needs. These guidelines \nare intended to support the enforcement of responsible breeding and good animal welfare practices by \ncompetent authorities. Where national legislation in a country sets higher criteria than those outlined in \nthese guidelines, the national legislation should take precedence. \n \nResearch into animal welfare and breed- specific predispositions to disease that inform responsible \nbreeding practices are ongoing; breeders and competent authorities should follow current best practices \nwhere these exceed the guidelines. This requires both breeders and competent authorities to regularly \nupdate their knowledge of cat welfare. \n \nAnimal welfare is a state within the animal that ranges from poor -through-to-good (Broom 1996). For \nexample, poor welfare arises when a cat is sick or injur ed or unable to express natural behaviours it is \nhighly motivated to perform; it is associated with negative emotions such as fear, distress, frustration, \nor boredom. Good welfare results when cats\u2019 experience positive physical and mental states (Green & \nMellor 2011; Mellor 2016), they are thriving \u2013 they are physically healthy, and living in a complex and \ninteresting environment where they have choice over what they do and when they do things; they feel \ncomfortable and secure; they have access to all neces sary resources. Cats experience a good quality \nof life when they are thriving. \n \nBreeders have a duty of care, to keep all cats in a state of good welfare, to ensure kittens have a good \nstart in life \u2013 they are functionally fit, healthy and socialised \u2013 they fulfil their potential to live a good \nquality of life in their new homes. Breeders are obliged to find responsible homes for kittens they have \nbred; ensuring new owners are a good match and understand their lifelong duty of care to their new cat.  \n \n \n2. Principles of responsible breeding \nA responsible cat breeder (adapted from RSPCA Australia 2018):  \n \nRespects the intrinsic value of cats  \n\u25cf Demonstrates a genuine concern for the welfare of cats and their future generations. Avoids \nbreeding from banned breeds  and their hybrids, animals that are closely related, or with \n                                                           \n1 Regardless of whether breeding is planned or accidental, cats and kittens should be cared for in the same way to protect and \npromote their welfare.

Selection of parents \n \n3.1 General considerations \n\u25cf Cats must not be bred which are from breeds (including their hybrids) that are banned by \nnational legislation. \n \n\u25cf Cats used for breeding must be health-checked by a veterinarian before breeding; they should \nbe functionally fit, physically healthy (in good body condition and free from obvious signs of \ninfection) and have good (confident and friendly) temperaments \u2013 these phenotypes are \ncompatible with a good quality of life. \n \n\u25cf Breeders are required to know the specific welfare risks of extreme conformations and inherited \ndisease related to breed or individual (Gough et al 2018). They should avoid breeding cats for \nextremes of physical type and minimise the extent of inbreeding (breeding from closely related \nindividuals) which has the potential to be detrimental to the cat\u2019s quality of life.  \n \n\u25cf Where a c at produces kittens with an inherited disease, extreme physical conformations or \nbehavioural characteristics that compromises their kittens\u2019 quality of life, this combination of \nparents, and their offspring must be excluded from future breeding. \n \n3.2 Behavioural traits \nCats\u2019 friendliness to people and ability to cope when meeting strangers later in life by their parents \ntemperament; kittens from bold, friendly fathers are more confident and friendly towards people and \ncope better when faced with challenges of meeting strangers or with unfamiliar environments later in \nlife (McCune 1995).  \n \n\u25cf Breeding cats should be friendly towards people, comfortable with being handled and confident \nliving in a home environment. Cats that are fearful or aggressive towards peop le should be \nexcluded from breeding. \n                                                           \n2 The terms of warranty may vary country-to-country and national legislation must be followed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3287, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0d97388-b69f-429b-b1ad-d573e2d33e19": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0d97388-b69f-429b-b1ad-d573e2d33e19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "cat1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/zen/Documents/DS/OpenAI/llamaindex-RAG/data/cat1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 402183, "creation_date": "2024-12-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4823cae1-2538-4cb5-bb1e-9e40630a55d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "cat1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/zen/Documents/DS/OpenAI/llamaindex-RAG/data/cat1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 402183, "creation_date": "2024-12-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-23"}, "hash": "c01bfc58a5ed5915c9687d95fe2766e03d91a586ba7bc495605ae61eb98d609a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "RESPONSIBLE CAT BREEDING GUIDELINES \n \n \n9 \nEndorsed by the EU Platform on Animal Welfare 3 November 2020 - DOC/2020/11982 Rev1. \n \n3.3 Inherited disorders \nAvoid inbreeding: Breeding from closely related cats such as brother and sister, mother and son or \nfather and daughter, grandfather and granddaughter, predispose kittens to genetic problems or birth \ndefects. The breeder must avoid inbreeding. \n \n\u25cf Inbreeding Coefficient. Selective breeding of individuals should not be undertaken without \nknowing the genetic similarity between two parents over the highest number of generations \n(e.g. at least 5). Breeders should avoid breeding from individual cats that produce a high \ncoefficient of inbreeding (greater than 20%; Governing Council of the Cat Fancy 2015), ideally \nthis coefficient should be below 10% (Governing Council of the Cat Fancy 2017).  \n \n\u25cf Popular Sire Effect. The \u2018popular sire effect\u2019 reduces genetic diversity of breeds which often \nleads to deleterious consequences for many future generations (Gough et al 2018). Breeders \nshould avoid overusing stud cats in the breeding population. As a general rule, cats should not \nsire more than 5% of the total kittens, in the specific pedigree population, during a 5- year \nperiod3. \n \nUse genetic Screening: Breeders are required to use all available, validated screening tests relevant to \nthe breed4 and in conjunction with veterinary advice (Lyons 2010), before they choose to breed from a \ncat. Screening tests will identify \u2018carrier\u2019 cats that are unaffected by the disease but carry the mutated \ngene; breeding between two carrier cats should be avoided to prevent their kittens  being affected. The \nresults of genetic screening tests should be provided to prospective new owners of kittens.  \n \nAvoid breeding for extremes: Cats may suffer as a result of extreme conformations, for example, \nBrachycephalism (being flat-faced), which produces anatomical defects to cats\u2019 skull affecting the brain, \neyes and upper airway, predisposing individuals to life-long neurological and eye-related problems, and \ndifficulties in breathing, sleeping (sleep apnoea), overheating and regurgitation (Internat ional Cat Care \n2016).  \n \n\u25cf Cats with extreme conformation5 (or those who have had corrective surgery) must not be bred \nfrom (or presented in breeding exhibitions); the corrective surgery should be noted in the \nrelevant health information alongside their microchip registration, and where appropriate health \npassport.   \n \n3.4 General health requirements \n\u25cf Both stud and queen must receive prophylactic health care under the direction of a veterinarian, \nincluding regular vaccinations, thorough clinical examination, and treatment for internal and \nexternal parasites. The timing of treatments must be under veterinary direction as some may \nbe harmful to the foetus if given during pregnancy or lactation. \n \nVaccination \nCats should be vaccinated by a veterinarian before mating;  queens recently vaccinated before \npregnancy will produce antibodies in colostrum (first milk) which will be passed on to kittens during \nnursing, conferring temporary immunity to specific diseases. \n \n                                                           \n3 Further research is needed to understand the acceptable threshold for cats. \n4 https://www.langfordvets.co.uk/diagnostic-laboratories/services/cat-genetic-testing/  \n5 https://www.wir-sind-tierarzt.de/download/BTK_Flyer_Qualzucht-Katze.pdf", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3467, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7102093a-cacb-421d-94e9-6cd3f0f44098": {"__data__": {"id_": "7102093a-cacb-421d-94e9-6cd3f0f44098", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "cat1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/zen/Documents/DS/OpenAI/llamaindex-RAG/data/cat1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 402183, "creation_date": "2024-12-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0c86109-1023-4c05-bce9-d5d6c17aee2d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "cat1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/zen/Documents/DS/OpenAI/llamaindex-RAG/data/cat1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 402183, "creation_date": "2024-12-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-23"}, "hash": "23c71173c047b74c8054ea4e77b0ac7f4fb83a14d746bcd1b76db1bb16d6d7e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "RESPONSIBLE CAT BREEDING GUIDELINES \n \n \n10 \nEndorsed by the EU Platform on Animal Welfare 3 November 2020 - DOC/2020/11982 Rev1. \nThe availability of core and non- core vaccines (Table 1; Day et al 2016) for cats will vary country -to-\ncountry.

The\nMediterranean was reconfirmed to be the probable site of domestication. Genetic diversity has remained broad throughout the world, with distinct\ngenetic clustering in the Mediterranean basin, Europe/America, Asia and Africa. However, Asian cats appeared to have separated early and\nexpanded in relative isolation. Most breeds were derived from indigenous cats of their purported regions of origin. However, the Persian and\nJapanese bobtail were more aligned with European/American than with Mediterranean basin or Asian clusters. Three recently derived breeds were\nnot distinct from their parental breeds of origin. Pure breeding was associated with a loss of genetic diversity; however, this loss did not correlate\nwith breed popularity or age.\n\u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, the initiation of domestication probably\nbegan thousands of years earlier as humans and ancestral cats\nbecame progressively more interdependent [2]. The domesti-\ncation process likely began during the period when humans\nceased following wild herds of animals and adopted more\nagricultural lifestyles, particularly in the Fertile Crescent[3].\nThis change occurred 10,000\u201311,000 years ago and was made\npossible by the domestication of certain wild grains and grasses\n[4]. The human/cat relationship was beneficial for the control of\ncrop-destroying rodents, which had also joined their evolution-\nary fate to human civilization. Although many cats eventually\nbecame pets, the modern cat is not fully domesticated in the\nclassic sense. Modern cats remain self-sufficient if need be,\nmaintaining keen hunting skills even when provided food and\nexhibiting a spectrum of behaviors ranging from untamable to\nhighly affectionate pets[5,6].\nCats spread to virtually all parts of the Old World, probably\nalong trade routes between ancient civilizations.

Of\nthe 41 breeds recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association\n(CFA)[11],1 6 \u201cnatural breeds\u201d are thought to be regional\nvariants that predate the cat fancy[12]. The remaining breeds\nwere developed over the past 50 years and are usually defined as\nsimple, single-gene variants derived from the natural breeds.\nThis is in stark contrast to most other domesticated species that\nhave undergone millennia of intense selection for complex\nbehavioral, performance, or production traits involving com-\nplex gene interactions[13].\nA recent phylogenetic study concludes that the domestic cat\nis the product of a single domestication event in the Near East\n[14]; however, dispersal patterns of the cat since that initial\ndomestication event have not yet been studied. The objectives\nof the present paper are threefold. The first is to trace the\njourney of the modern cat through the ancient world and to the\nAmericas, thereby supporting origins of domestication. The\nsecond objective is to measure any changes in genetic diversity\nthat may have occurred during the movement of cats from the\nFertile Crescent. The third objective is to measure any loss of\ngenetic diversity that might be ascribed to the development of\nolder (foundation) or more contemporary breeds. Genetic data,\nreported herein, are derived from over 1100 cats, representing\n17 populations of random-bred cats dispersed over five regions\n(Europe, Mediterranean, Asia, Africa, Americas), as well as 22\nrecognized breeds, including both foundation and several\nmodern breeds (Table 1). Highly polymorphic microsatellite\nmarkers [15] were used to determine genetic relationships of cat\nbreeds, geographical origins, and the levels of genetic loss due\nto inbreeding.\nResults\nPhylogeographical structure of domestic cats\nA Bayesian analysis of random-bred cat populations using the\nsoftware STRUCTURE[16] elucidated the phylogeography of the\ndomestic cat. The clustering patterns were examined with ancestral\ngroups (K) set between 2 and 4. The first split (K=2) se pa ra te d\nAsian and East African cats from all other populations (Fig. 1a).\nThe Mediterranean basin populations were separated from the\nEuropean populations atK= 3. East African cats formed a separate\nand distinct cluster atK=4. The result of theK= 4 analysis clearly\ndelineated four genetic clusters of cats, corresponding to Europe,\nthe Mediterranean basin, East Africa, and Asia.\nWe next included cat breeds in the Bayesian analyses to\ndetermine the most basal relationships among all cat breeds and\nall random-bred cat populations. AtK= 2, 4 of 5 Asian random-\nbred cat populations grouped with 6 of 7 Asian breeds with\nposterior probabilities of 75\u201385%; this grouping of 10 popula-\ntions was also distinct from all other cat populations (Fig. 1b). At\nK=3, the groupings were refined into a Southeast Asian cluster,\na Western European cluster, and a cluster that included all other\ncats from the Mediterranean basin, East Africa, and Northern\nAsia. Cats from Singapore were an admixture of cats of Asian\nand European origins. American random-bred cats grouped with\nrandom-bred cats from Western Europe. Italian cats appeared to\nbe an admixture of European and Mediterranean stock.\nSoutheast Asian breeds clustered with the feral populations\nfrom Vietnam. Of the Asian breeds, only the Japanese Bobtail\ngrouped strongly with Western cats, albeit with some Asian\ninfluence. The two breeds that originated in the United States\n(Maine Coon and American Shorthair) clustered with the seven\nWestern European breeds. The Persian breed unexpectedly\nclustered with cats from Western Europe.

A range of cluster numbers was\nexamined, with 20 chosen as the most appropriate. This method\nseparated the cats into inferred clusters corresponding to their\nbreed designation (Fig. 1c) and with a purported accuracy of\n95% [20].

Average number of alleles\nper locus, average inbreeding coefficient (FIS), and allelic\nrichness followed a similar trend (Table 1, Fig. 4).\nDiscussion\nGenetics of the feline diaspora\nRecently, strong evidence has suggested that cat domestica-\ntion occurred in the Near Eastern part of the Fertile Crescent\npursuant to agricultural development[14]. The Mediterranean\nbasin has been previously suggested as the site for cat domestica-\ntion based on archeological evidence[1,21]. Driscoll and col-\nleagues [14] used mitochondrial sequence and microsatellite\nmarkers to elucidate the origin of cat domestication. Because\nmicrosatellite markers are a better indicator of more recent\ngenetic diversity, this study focused on microsatellite markers to\nevaluate the more recent breed origins. Based on the present\nstudy, genetic diversity was not substantially decreased by the\nsubsequent diaspora of modern cats from the Mediterranean to\nother areas of the ancient world. However, there were interesting\nregional differences in their genetic makeup. FCA, Bayesian\nclustering, and neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees divided all\nof the world's cats into four distinct groups: Asia, Mediterranean\nbasin, Western Europe, and East Africa. American cats consis-\ntently grouped with cats from Western Europe, suggesting Eu-\nropean settlers probably brought cats to the New World and the\ncat's time in America has been too brief for significant genetic\ndifferentiation.\nGenetic diversity remained fairly uniform among various\nareas within the Mediterranean region. The constant movement\nof ships and caravans, as well as cats, in this key region of early\ncivilization would have promoted a constant interchange of cats.\nAlthough Mediterranean cats tended to be genetically uniform,\nthere were some interesting differences and relationships\nbetween certain areas within the Mediterranean region. Bayesian\nanalysis indicated that Italian and Tunisian cats were an\nadmixture of Western European and Mediterranean cats. This\nmixing supported the historical ties between Tunisia and\nWestern European countries. Cats from Sri Lanka and Singapore\nFig. 2. Neighbor-joining tree of cat breeds and populations.

However,\nsome Singapore cats did not appear to be hybrids, but rather a\nmixed sampling of genetically different cats. This may have\nbeen a relic of British colonialism or recent importation.\nAccording to the FCA ( Fig. 3), Sri Lankan cats and the\nAbyssinian breed bridged cats of the East and West, perhaps\nresulting from maritime trade routes in the Arabian Sea or again\nfrom recent British colonialism. The most interesting difference\ninvolved the Asian cluster of cats, which was genetically distinct\nfrom cats of the Mediterranean basin, Western Europe, and\nAfrica. This pattern of genetic diversity indicates that the first\ndomestic cats reached the Far East relatively early, followed by a\nlong period of relative isolation. This isolation may have been\ncaused by the waxing and waning of trade between successions\nof great ancient empires. The Asian population was of further\ninterest because it was internally segregated. Populations of cats\nfrom different parts of Asia (random bred and purebred) were\nmore genetically divergent from one another than local\npopulations within the Mediterranean basin or Western Europe-\nan clusters. This partitioning of genetic diversity within the\nAsian population was also corroborated by the longer branch\nlengths within the Asian clade on the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2).\nThis suggests not only that the Asian population was relatively\nisolated from the three other regional clusters, but also that cats\nwithin various regions of Asia were kept separate.\nGenetic variation across random-bred and purebred\npopulations\nThe substructuring of populations is important for parentage\nanalyses, forensic applications, individual matching, and disease\nstudies. Random-bred cats have the largest within-population\nvariance, consistent with their larger population sizes, freedom\nto migrate, and no artificial selection. However, the various\nbreeds of cats exhibit the largest among population variance,\nreflecting their distinctness. The within-population variance\ncomponent of random-bred cats was 86%, compared to 93\u201395%\nin humans [22], suggesting that individual cat populations are\nless genetically variable than human populations. Purebred cats,\nwith a within-population variance component of only 61%, were\nless genetically variable than the random-bred populations,\nwhich was also reflected in the estimates of average heterozy-\ngosity. The average heterozygosity of the breeds was 10% lower\nthan that of the random-bred populations (Fig. 4), which in turn\nwas 10% lower than the average for human populations. World-\nwide human populations range from 0.50 to 0.78 in average\nheterozygosity, most being above 0.70. The among-populations\nbetween-regions variance of cat populations was approximately\ntwice that seen in humans (6% in cats, 2.5% in humans) as was\nthe among-regions variance (8% in cats, 3.6\u20134.3% in humans).\nTable 2\nAMOV A of cat breeds and random-bred populations\nVariance components (%)Sample\nWithin\npopulations\nAmong populations\nwithin regions\nAmong\nregions\nBreeds 61 24 15\nRandom bred 86 6 8\nCombined 73 18 9\nFig. 3.

The large\namong-populations (24%) and among-regions (15%) variance\nof the breeds is likely a result of the intensive artificial selection\nand isolation imposed by breeding practices. The Burmese and\nSingapura breeds have the lowest heterozygosity and the highest\nFIS of any breed, reflecting the most intense inbreeding (Fig. 4).\nThe newest CFA breed, the Siberian, had the highest variation,\ncomparable to random-bred populations. This indicates that it\nwas derived from a broad foundation stock. The Sphynx, which\nis a derivative of the Devon Rex breed, also had high genetic\ndiversity. Given these results, Burmese and Singapura breeders\nshould be concerned about genetic diversity, while Siberian\nbreeders should be encouraged to retain existing diversity as\ntheir breed becomes more established. Similar to the conserva-\ntion efforts in captive exotic felid populations, genetic analyses,\nbreed histories, and population dynamics could be used to\ndevelop breed management or survival programs to maintain\ngenetic variation within the breed gene pool for an extended\nperiod of time. In addition, these regional differences in the\ngenetic variation of cats suggest that the genetic markers used in\ncat DNA profiling should be tested in the diverse populations to\nvalidate their efficiency.\nGenetic structure and origins of cat breeds\nWe have demonstrated that genetic diversity following\ndomestication was regionalized in areas of the ancient world\nand even within localities within those regions. Some differ-\nences could be explained by isolation, while others were best\nexplained by interchanges of animals between clusters and\nlocalities. All of these differences involved human activities, but\nwere probably not strictly intentional. However, intentional\nchanges in the genetics of cats ultimately occurred during the\ndevelopment of breeds.\nUnlike breeds of domestic horses, dogs, cattle, sheep, etc.,\nsome of which are thousands of years old, most cat breeds were\ndeveloped within the past 150 years, mainly in Europe and the\nUnited States[12]. Although documentation for nearly 80 cat\nbreeds exists, the largest cat fancy association recognizes only\n41 breeds[23,24]. The Persian, Russian Blue, Siamese, and\nAngora were among the first cat breeds registered by cat\nassociations. The CFA designates 16 cat breeds as\u201cnatural\u201d or\n\u201cfoundation.\u201d Fifteen of the foundation breeds are included in\nthis study, lacking only the Manx, the tailless breed of cat that\nwas developed on the Isle of Man.\nPurebred cats had similar structuring to the random-bred cats\nof their regions. The Southeast Asian breeds, including Birman,\nBurmese, Havana Brown, Korat, Siamese, and Singapura, form\na grouping that is distinct and at the opposite end of the genetic\nspectrum from the Western breeds, as depicted by the FCA. The\nAbyssinians and Japanese Bobtails were exceptions and\npossessed genetic markers common to both Southeast Asian\nand Western breeds. This indicates that cats from both Asia and\nEurope were used to create these breeds.\nEach of the foundation breeds was genetically distinguish-\nable with 95% accuracy from the others. One of the oldest\nrecognized cat breeds, the Persian, has been used in the\nFig. 4. Genetic diversity indices of breeds, random-bred populations, and wildcats.

Crossbreeding with\nPersian cats is often used to produce a more brachycephalic\nhead type. The Exotic Shorthair is essentially a shorthaired\nvariant of the Persian, which is demonstrated by the complete\nclustering of these two breeds as one group. The most dolichoce-\nphalic breed, the Siamese, has also been used to create numerous\nother breeds, including Colorpoints, Orientals, Havana Browns,\nand longhaired breed variants. Although listed as different, most\nof these derived breeds vary by only a single gene variant, such\nas hair length, color patterns, or fur coloration; thus, these\nderived breeds will likely be inseparable as distinct breeds, as\nwas shown with the Havana Brown and Siamese. The Burmese\nand Singapura grouping proved to be an additional example of\nrecent breed derivations. The close associations of the Persian\nand Exotic, the Siamese and Havana Brown, and the Burmese\nand Singapura resulted in the highest branch supports in the\nneighbor-joining tree and the inability to separate members of\neach pair by the genetic markers used in this study. However, it is\nimportant to remember that most breeds have a written/oral\nhistory in addition to a genetic fingerprint. Cat breeding folklore\ncontends that both Burmese and Singapura are indigenous to\nancient Burma. Folklore also suggests that Burmese cats from\nthe United States were taken to Singapore, purposely bred with\nnative cats, and then later returned to the United States as the new\nbreed Singapura. Havana Browns are considered a separate\nbreed in the United States; however, European cat breed\nassociations consider them only a color variant of Siamese.\nThese data show that most, but not all, foundation or modern\nbreeds appeared to have originated from random-bred cats of\nthe purported region of origin. The Southeast Asian breeds were\nstrongly associated with the random-bred cats from Vietnam,\nChina, Korea, and Singapore. The Siberian is one of the newest\ncat breeds from Russia and is actively under development.\nRandom-bred cats from Russia were not available, but the\nSiberian had strong associations with cats from the nearby\ncountries of Germany and Finland. Turkish Vans grouped with\nregional random-bred cats from Turkey, Israel, and Egypt.\nLikewise, cats from the Kenyan islands of Lamu and Pate group\nwith the Sokoke breed, which was developed in Kenya. The\nKenyan islands and the mainland were accessed via shipping\nroutes in the Arabian Sea, allowing exchange between India, the\nNear East, the Arabian Peninsula, and Africa. All other breeds\nand random-bred populations form a network of closely related\nand less distinctive cats of Western European grouping. Surpris-\ningly, the Persian breed was not genetically associated with\nrandom-bred cat populations from the Near East, but grouped\nwith random bred cats of Western Europe. The Persian is\nperhaps the oldest recognized cat breed and has undergone\nselection for an extreme phenotype, which likely involved\ncomplex gene interaction. Even though the early Persian cat\nmay have in fact originated from ancient Persia, the modern\nPersian cat has lost its phylogeographical signature. Similarly,\nthe Japanese Bobtail does not appear to hail from its stated\norigins of Japan. Although cats were not indigenous to Japan,\nthey migrated to the islands as part of Asian trade routes\nhundreds of years ago. Introduced as a breed in the United\nStates in 1968, Japanese Bobtails from the United States appear\nto have been influenced more in their gene pool by European\ncats than by Asian cats. Egyptian Maus also appear to be on the\nverge of losing their historical origins via genetic influences from\nEurope. Overall, these results indicate that both the random-bred\nand the breed populations group in a manner largely concordant\nwith geography.

We obtained DNA samples\nof most breeds at cat shows and by request from cat owners in the United States.\nKorat, Turkish Angora, Turkish Van, and Siberian samples were acquired from\nthe United States and Europe because these breeds have the same standards\nbetween continents. We reviewed pedigrees to ensure that no first-degree\nrelatives were included in the study and that a majority of cats did not share\ncommon grandparents. The random-bred cats included feral cats that have no\nfeeding or housing assistance from humans, random-bred cats that have had\nsome influence by humans, and cats owned and cared for by humans but that are\nnot of a specific breed. For random-bred populations, we did not include\nlittermates or both parents and their kittens. We used sterile cytological brushes\nto noninvasively obtain buccal (cheek) cells and the QIAmp DNA mini kit\n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) to extract the DNA. Samples from Kenya and U.S.\nrandom-bred populations were provided as blood or tissue, and we extracted the\nDNA using standard phenol/chloroform[25]. African wildcat (F. s. caffra) [10]\nand European wildcat (F . s. silvestris) [26] DNA samples were provided from\nprevious studies. The Arabian wildcats (F . s. tristami) were collected in Israel.\nWe used the Replig-G kit (Qiagen) to augment in part the wildcat DNA samples\nby multistrand-displacement whole-genome amplification.\nGenotyping\nThirty-eight microsatellites were genotyped in 1176 cats representing 22\nbreeds, 17 random-bred and 3 wild populations (Table 1). On average, each\nrandom-bred and purebred population was represented by 35 and 25 cats,\nrespectively, ranging from 10 to 70 for the domestic cats. For wildcat populations\n5 to 10 samples were genotyped. The microsatellite markers were chosen based\n19M.J.

The estimated log-probability of the data for a\ngiven value ofK in the range of interest displayed a flat trend (data not shown).\nThis suggests that STRUCTURE was unable to determine which number of\ninferred ancestral populations in the biologically significant range (those\nsurrounding 22) was the most probable. We therefore choseK=20 as the best\nfit because, at that value, the genetic clusters formed by the analysis most closely\ncorresponded to supposed breeds. Assignment testing was performed using the\nBayesian methods of Rannala and Mountain [30], as implemented by\nGENECLASS2 [20].\nTree building\nPhylogenetic trees were constructed with the entire dataset (PHYLIP)[31].\nA series of components was employed in the following order: Seqboot,\nGenedist, Neighbor, and Consense. We used Genedist to produce both Nei's\ngenetic distance and Cavalli-Sforza's chord measure outfiles so that two differ-\nent trees were produced under these two distance measures. In each case, the\ntrees were bootstrapped with 1000 iterations to assess confidence. We used\nTreeView[32] to visualize the resulting trees.\nAMOVA\nTo quantify the degree of regional differentiation, we performed an AMOV A\n[19] in three parts: breeds only, random-bred populations only, and the\ncombined dataset, which did not include wildcats (Arlequin) [33].
